Create a website that users can purchase video games on

For this exam you will create a folder named lastname_exam2. You will create a website for a 
small gaming company. The index page should have a picture of your choice at the top left, the made-up 
name of your company to the right and a menu area below with links to three pages, buyproducts, and 
confirmproducts. All pages should have this same format at the top. In addition, the 
output area in the center should be formatted with a color scheme other than white background with 
black lettering. Make the page somewhat attractive, but mostly functional and readable. 

The first page is buyproducts, for this page you will create a form that allows the user to 
purchase products.  There should be a drop down for the user to select which product they want, with 
the list being the products given below.  The date of this purchase should show at the top left and be 
automatically set for today.  The user should also be able to enter a quantity of items to purchase, in the 
range of 1-20.  As the product and quantity are selected, an area to the right should show the base price 
of one item, the total price for all items purchased, the sales tax with a rate of 11% and the final total.  
They can only purchase one product at a time.  There should also be a submit button, which should take 
the user to the confirmproducts page which will show all the purchase information as well as the date.
